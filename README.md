## 💼 Experience

**Dot Net Intern | AI Developer Intern** @ **EssilorLuxottica SSC** (Bengaluru, Karnataka)
*05/2025 - 07/2025*

  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tZk9d3P/robot-typing.gif" alt="AI Chatbot GIF" width="400"/>
</p>

As an AI Developer Intern, I had the opportunity to build and deploy a production-level AI chatbot from the ground up.

* I developed an AI chatbot using Flask and the Gemini API, which was later scaled to production with Azure OpenAI.
* The chatbot was integrated with Microsoft Teams and enterprise tools like JIRA, significantly cutting down response times for support queries.
* To enhance the chatbot's knowledge base, I designed a custom data crawler to process information from diverse sources including APIs, logs, and documents.
* I leveraged Gemini to intelligently classify incoming tickets, improving data retrieval and LLM readability.
* I managed the entire project lifecycle, from cloud hosting on Azure to system integration, testing, and creating comprehensive documentation.
